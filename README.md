Pet classification model using CNN Architecture
In my project on pet classification, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The dataset consisted of numerous images of these pets, and to enhance the model's performance, I utilized data augmentation techniques such as flipping, cropping, and blurring to artificially expand the dataset. This approach helped the model generalize better by exposing it to a wider variety of image variations.

To gain deeper insights into the data, I performed various visualizations, which provided a better understanding of the image distributions and the impact of augmentation. The CNN model was built using the Keras Sequential API, known for its simplicity and efficiency in creating deep learning models.

The architecture of the CNN included multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for classification. I used appropriate techniques such as dropout to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's robustness.

Training the model involved iterating over several epochs, adjusting hyperparameters to optimize performance, and evaluating the model using accuracy and loss metrics. The model demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing between dog and cat images, indicating its effectiveness.

Overall, this project showcased the application of CNNs in image classification tasks, emphasizing the importance of data augmentation and visualization in improving model performance and understanding data characteristics. The resulting model can be a valuable tool for automated pet classification in various applications.
